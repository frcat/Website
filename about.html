    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      I am a streamer that likes to code & game, oh yeah and sleep I like to sleep a lot
      <br><br>
      I mostly work on server sided projects but most of the stuff I have on github is client side/static
      <br><br>
      I <strong>love</strong> the horror catagory. It can be anything games and movies.
      <br><br>
      I'm a selective mute mostly in vrchat but can also show on stream ðŸ˜…
      <br>
      I do talk most of the time on stream though.
