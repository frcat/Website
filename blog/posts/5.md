# iOS 16

I tried not to update

yknow I want to jailbreak and get customiaztion all that good stuff

Holy shit when I say the homescreen customization is too much I mean it

And with <a href="https://scriptable.app/">Scriptable</a> you can customize your homescreen as well 

Apple is on the right track
